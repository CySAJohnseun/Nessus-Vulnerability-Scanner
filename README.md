## Objective

The project objective is to demonstrate the installation of Nessus, a leading vulnerability scanner, on Kali Linux. The process includes signing up for a license, downloading the software, and executing installation commands. A vulnerability scan is then performed on a Metasploitable system to identify and analyze vulnerabilities. This showcases the importance of using Nessus for vulnerability assessment and remediation in real-world scenarios, contributing to understanding IT security fundamentals.

### Skills Learned

- **Vulnerability scanning:** Conducting vulnerability scans using Nessus to identify potential weaknesses in systems.
- **Vulnerability analysis:** Analyzing scan results to assess the severity of identified vulnerabilities and prioritize remediation efforts.
- **Real-world application:** Applying Nessus in practical scenarios, such as scanning a Metasploitable system, to simulate cybersecurity challenges.
- **Remediation planning:** Developing strategies to address identified vulnerabilities and improve overall security posture.
- **IT security fundamentals:** Gaining insights into key concepts and practices, including the importance of vulnerability assessment and remediation.

### Tools Used

- **Nessus Vulnerability Scanner**: Utilized for conducting vulnerability scans and analyzing scan results.
- **Metasploitable**: Used as a target system for vulnerability scanning and analysis.
- **Kali Linux**: Operating system environment for running the Nessus Vulnerability Scanner and conducting scans.


## What is Nessus Vulnerability Scanner? 
Nessus Vulnerability Scanner, developed by Tenable, is a powerful tool used to identify weaknesses in computer systems and networks. It acts like a digital security inspector. Nessus works in phases: first, it scans ports on a device to see which services are running. Then, it uses a vast library of pre-built checks, called plugins, to probe these services for known vulnerabilities. These plugins can identify outdated software, misconfigurations, and weaknesses specific to different operating systems and applications. By analyzing the results, Nessus provides a vulnerability report, allowing IT professionals to prioritize and address potential security risks.

## What is Metasplotable 2?

Metasploitable-2 is an intentionally vulnerable Linux virtual machine (VM) designed specifically for cybersecurity training and experimentation. It comes packed with a variety of known vulnerabilities, such as weak passwords, outdated software, and misconfigured services. Security professionals and students use Metasploitable-2 as a target within a controlled environment to practice exploiting these vulnerabilities, testing security tools, and learning penetration testing techniques. This allows them to gain hands-on experience understanding how attacks work and how to defend against them in real-world scenarios.

## What is Kali Linux?

Kali Linux is a specialized Linux distribution designed for penetration testing and digital forensics. It's like a powerful toolbox for cybersecurity professionals. At its core, Kali Linux is a version of Linux (like Windows or macOS are operating systems). However, it comes packed with a vast collection of pre-installed security tools for tasks like vulnerability scanning, network mapping, password cracking, and exploiting software weaknesses. These tools, combined with Kali's focus on security customization, make it an ideal platform for cybersecurity professionals to simulate attacks, identify potential risks in systems, and develop countermeasures.

## Remediating a Severe CVSS 10.0 Vulnerability

### VNC Server 'password' Password
![image](https://github.com/CySAJohnseun/Nessus-Vulnerability-Scanner/assets/166464506/7759ed6e-6304-4576-98cf-aa1cad2dff26)

Detailing specific vulnerabilities offers essential insights into their nature and potential impact. This includes examining Plug Details such as Severity, ID, Vulnerability Type, and Family, along with Risk Information like Risk Factor, CVSS v2.0 Base Score, and Vector. Furthermore, understanding the Description of the Vulnerability and its recommended Solution provides crucial guidance for effective remediation strategies.

The identified vulnerability pertains to the VNC (Virtual Network Computing) server operating on the remote host, characterized by a critical severity level. The vulnerability, assigned ID 61708, stems from the usage of a weak password to secure the VNC server. Nessus successfully authenticated using the default password 'password,' indicating a significant security lapse. This vulnerability poses a severe risk as it enables a remote, unauthenticated attacker to potentially gain control of the system. The recommended solution involves securing the VNC service by implementing a robust, non-default password to mitigate the risk of unauthorized access and potential exploitation.
