## What is Nessus Vulnerability Scanner? 
Nessus Vulnerability Scanner, developed by Tenable, is a powerful tool used to identify weaknesses in computer systems and networks. It acts like a digital security inspector. Nessus works in phases: first, it scans ports on a device to see which services are running. Then, it uses a vast library of pre-built checks, called plugins, to probe these services for known vulnerabilities. These plugins can identify outdated software, misconfigurations, and weaknesses specific to different operating systems and applications. By analyzing the results, Nessus provides a vulnerability report, allowing IT professionals to prioritize and address potential security risks.

## What is Metasplotable 2?

Metasploitable-2 is an intentionally vulnerable Linux virtual machine (VM) designed specifically for cybersecurity training and experimentation. It comes packed with a variety of known vulnerabilities, such as weak passwords, outdated software, and misconfigured services. Security professionals and students use Metasploitable-2 as a target within a controlled environment to practice exploiting these vulnerabilities, testing security tools, and learning penetration testing techniques. This allows them to gain hands-on experience understanding how attacks work and how to defend against them in real-world scenarios.

## What is Kali Linux?
Kali Linux is a specialized Linux distribution designed for penetration testing and digital forensics. It's like a powerful toolbox for cybersecurity professionals. At its core, Kali Linux is a version of Linux (like Windows or macOS are operating systems). However, it comes packed with a vast collection of pre-installed security tools for tasks like vulnerability scanning, network mapping, password cracking, and exploiting software weaknesses. These tools, combined with Kali's focus on security customization, make it an ideal platform for cybersecurity professionals to simulate attacks, identify potential risks in systems, and develop countermeasures.

Detailing specific vulnerabilities offers essential insights into their nature and potential impact. This includes examining Plug Details such as Severity, ID, Vulnerability Type, and Family, along with Risk Information like Risk Factor, CVSS v2.0 Base Score, and Vector. Furthermore, understanding the Description of the Vulnerability and its recommended Solution provides crucial guidance for effective remediation strategies.

The identified vulnerability pertains to the VNC (Virtual Network Computing) server operating on the remote host, characterized by a critical severity level. The vulnerability, assigned ID 61708, stems from the usage of a weak password to secure the VNC server. Nessus successfully authenticated using the default password 'password,' indicating a significant security lapse. This vulnerability poses a severe risk as it enables a remote, unauthenticated attacker to potentially gain control of the system. The recommended solution involves securing the VNC service by implementing a robust, non-default password to mitigate the risk of unauthorized access and potential exploitation.

I ran "ip a" to confirm by cross-referencing the IP address from my virtual machine with the IP address obtained remotely (identical IP addresses).

## Conclusion
The project highlights the critical importance of vulnerability scanning in cybersecurity. Utilizing tools like Nessus Vulnerability Scanner, we've gained vital insights into identifying and addressing system weaknesses. Real-world applications, such as scanning vulnerable systems, emphasize the need for proactive security measures. These lessons stress the importance of continuous vigilance against evolving cyber threats
